# Mini_Project

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### To build a platform which has inventory of all sports infrastructures and clubs. It will act as an intermediate between users and infrastructures.

## INTRODUCTION
### Sports are not all about winning games. Building healthier, happier, safer, and strong communities are also essential elements. Communities that get a chance to participate in sports also develop strong social bonds. As a result, many non-profit sports organizations have ventured into helping society through sports.People who play, exercise, and are active daily are strong and healthy. For example, delayed onset of diabetes, low blood pressure, lowers cardiovascular diseases and general body health are some of the ways sports facilities help in the communityâ€™s health. Furthermore, strengthening the immune system and increasing white blood cells are other benefits of exercising. Reducing Stress - The benefits of exercises are extended to the way people think and their mental states. Stress affects communities at large, but people engaging in exercising activities are resilient to stress. Sports and recreational activities have positive impacts on happiness.
### Sports infrastructure, such as stadiums, sports halls, swimming pools, fitness facilities, ski resorts, golf courses and other sports infrastructure.

## OBJECTIVE
### A website which has inventory of all sports infrastructures. It will include both indoor and outdoor games. Outdoor games like Cricket, Football, Hockey, Basketball, Volleyball, Kabaddi, Tennis, table tennis, Kho Kho, and more. Indoor Games like Chess, Carrom, Club games like pool table, Bowling etc. It will contain information like full address, contact number, timings, admission fees, reviews, ownership of the infrastructure. Both users and the infrastructure will be able to sign up and login. Users can register into the infrastructure through the website. Users can rate and review the infrastructures. Using this, the infrastructure can improve themselves.

## SCOPE
### Our project the inventory of sports infrastructure can be a great deal for both sportspeople and infrastructures. Both parties will definitely benefit from it. It will help sportspersons to find the best sports infrastructure according to their requirements. It will further be very helpful in their career. Infrastructures will gain a lot of users. They can upgrade & improve themselves and gain more users. Clubs will also gain a lot of users. Most people are unaware about the clubs in their areas. It will be really helpful for the clubs.

## Conclusion
### Our site will connect sportspeople to infrastructure/clubs. It will act as an intermediate. It fulfills our objectives and problem statement. It has been a great pleasure for us to work on this exciting and challenging project.

## Future Scope
### Our project Inventory of Sports Infrastructure is ready with its base. But there can be further more features added to it. We are planning to integrate the admission process to the infrastructure and clubs directly from our website. The infrastructures and clubs will also be able to display their admission fees, memberships, offers etc on their profile on our website. For tournaments, we are planning to add registration process functionality. Also we are going to add support for events, their registration, time details etc.
